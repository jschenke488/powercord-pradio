# PRadio: Stream radio in Discord

This plugin allows you to listen to your favorite radio stations while talking to your best friends. <br>
You can specify your own radio stream in the settings.<br>
I will add a custom playing modal in the future and a option to automatically turn the volume down once someone is talking.<br>
<br>
<b>
  Important: The provided url MUST be a link to a DIRECT MEDIA STREAM. This means https://radioXYZ.fm is not a valid url!<br>
  Stream urls normaly look like https://play.radioXYZ.fm/source.mp3
</b>

## Support

If you need help, please feel free to contact me on Discord (Parzival#0002).<br>
You can also create a new issue on GitHub. It normaly doesn't take long for me to repsond.

## Installation

1. Go to your powercord plugins folder. Run ``git clone https://github.com/malte-linke/powercord-pradio.git``
2. Restart discord to fetch missing plugins.
